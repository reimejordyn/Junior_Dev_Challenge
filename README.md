# üöÄ IDToday Frontend Coding Challenge

## üìù Challenge Outline

This repository contains the starting point of a poorly implemented To-Do list app. Your objective is to refine the app's code, transpile JavaScript to TypeScript, enhance the UI, and implement any missing features.

You have the freedom to achieve these tasks your way, however, we encourage the following:

- Use short, descriptive variable names
- Well-commented code
- Responsive design
- Application state management
- Utilize a CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap, MaterialUI, or TailwindCSS - our favorite)
- Write basic unit and component tests
- Develop reusable components and utility functions
- Implement custom hooks and form validation if necessary

### üéØ Required Functionality

Below are the functionalities you need to implement. Creation and display of a "To-Do" are provided, your task is to add the rest.

- **Core Functions:**

  - Create a to-do
  - Delete a to-do
  - Update a to-do

- **Each To-Do Should Include:**

  - Title
  - Description
  - Status (to-do, in progress, done)
  - Creation Date
  - Deadline
  - Priority (low, medium, high)

- **UI Structure:**
  - Three columns: To-Do, In Progress, Done
  - Automatic categorization based on status
